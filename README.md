# Web Client SDK

## Please note that as of January 10th, all older versions of the Web SDK (versions 1.8.3 and below) will no longer have computer audio functionality within meetings.Â Please upgrade to version 1.8.5 or above to avoid service disruption.

Zoom offers a web based HTML5 client that is used in environments where the end users cannot download zoom desktop clients due to internal IT restrictions or in very low bandwidth environments.

The web client lets end users join a meeting, receive screen share from other attendees, join the meeting through the phone and leave the meeting. Zoom has added a Web SDK as part of our developer platform to enable developers to embed this into their web apps. Key functions that are exposed include: init meeting config, join meeting, show/hide invite function, show/hide meeting header, get attendees list, call out, invite by phone, mute, unmute, mute all, unmute all, rename, expel, record, lock meeting, leave meeting, end meeting.

Supported Browsers: Google Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla Firefox with their latest version

[Upcoming changes](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/getting-started/stay-up-to-date/upcoming-changes/web-sdk)

### Upgrading from 1.8.3 to 1.8.6

Since we replaced jQuery with Axios, you will need to change the following line.

default [en-US.json](https://source.zoom.us/1.8.6/lib/lang/en-US.json)
```
$.i18n -> ZoomMtg.i18n

case 1: load en-US, jp-JP, zh-CN, but use jp-JP by default

ZoomMtg.i18n.load('en-US');
ZoomMtg.i18n.load('jp-JP');
ZoomMtg.i18n.load('zh-CN');
ZoomMtg.i18n.reload('jp-JP');

case 2: only load jp-JP
ZoomMtg.i18n.load('jp-JP');
ZoomMtg.i18n.reload('jp-JP');

case 3: load youself json file

ZoomMtg.i18n.load('you jason url', 'you-lang-name');
ZoomMtg.i18n.reload('you-lang-name');

other: if you joined meeting and want change language, you need add another api
ZoomMtg.reRender({lang: 'zoom support language or you-lang-name' });
```

### Dependencies

console.log(JSON.stringify(ZoomMtg.checkSystemRequirements()));

// it's option if you want to change the WebSDK dependency link resources. setZoomJSLib must be run at first
// if (!china) ZoomMtg.setZoomJSLib('https://source.zoom.us/1.8.6/lib', '/av'); // CDN version default
